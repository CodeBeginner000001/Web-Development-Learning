        A lithium-ion or Li-ion battery is a type of rechargeable battery which uses the reversible 
        reduction of lithium ions to store energy. The negative electrode of a conventional lithium-ion 
        cell is typically graphite, a form of carbon. This negative electrode is sometimes called the anode
        as it acts as an anode during discharge. The positive electrode is typically a metal oxide; 
        the positive electrode is sometimes called the cathode as it acts as a cathode during discharge. 
        Positive and negative electrodes remain positive and negative in normal use whether charging or 
        discharging and are therefore clearer terms to use than anode and cathode which are reversed during 
        charging.[9]

        The electrolyte is typically a lithium salt in an organic solvent.[10][11]

        It is the predominant battery type used in portable consumer electronics and electric vehicles. 
        It also sees significant use for grid-scale energy storage and military and aerospace applications. 
        Compared to other rechargeable battery technologies, Li-ion batteries have high energy densities, 
        low self-discharge, and no memory effect (although a small memory effect reported in lithium iron 
        phosphate batteries has been traced to poorly made cells).[12]

        Chemistry, performance, cost, and safety characteristics vary across types of lithium-ion batteries. 
        Most commercial Li-ion cells use intercalation compounds as active materials. The anode or negative 
        electrode is usually graphite, although silicon-carbon is also being increasingly used. Cells can be 
        manufactured to prioritize either energy or power density.[13] Handheld electronics mostly use lithium 
        polymer batteries (with a polymer gel as electrolyte), a lithium cobalt oxide (LiCoO2) cathode material, 
        and a graphite anode, which together offer a high energy density.[14][15]
