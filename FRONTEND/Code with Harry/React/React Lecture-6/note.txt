### Using Props in React

In React, you can pass data to components using props. There are two common ways to use props: 

1. **Using Props in the Constructor Mode**:
    - Here, you access the props object in the function parameter and then use `props.<parameter_name>` to 
    access individual properties.

    ```javascript
    export default function Navbar(props) {
        return (
            <>
                <h1>{props.title}</h1>
            </>
        );
    }
    ```

    - Using the component in `App.js`:

    ```javascript
    <Navbar title="This is the title of the navbar" />
    ```

2. **Using Props in the Destructured Mode**:
    - In this approach, you destructure the props object directly in the function parameter, allowing you to use 
    the properties directly by name.

    ```javascript
    export default function Navbar({ title }) {
        return (
            <>
                <h1>{title}</h1>
            </>
        );
    }
    ```

    - Using the component in `App.js`:

    ```javascript
    <Navbar title="This is the title of the navbar" />
    ```

These methods both achieve the same result. The destructuring 
approach is often preferred for its brevity and clarity, especially when dealing with multiple props.
