a new syntax if nothing is defined in type if type is used
that is using "props && "
for example:-

alert is a prop then we can write like
alert && <h1>I am Alert</h1>

so if alert is true then only h1 tag will be executed else if the alert is false then h1 tag is not executed.

This happens because all the JSX will be converted to Javascript calls.
