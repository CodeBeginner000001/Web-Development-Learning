since React-router-dom is upgrade to a next level 
--> Old working of router told by harry will not working

given below is the new method
1. import {createBrowserRouter , RouterProvider}from 'react-router-dom'.
note:- RouterProvider is used to tell where u want to use the delcared router.

2. createBrowserRouter is used to create a router.
it takes 2 arguments in the form of objects within array
-> route:- it is an array of objects.
-> element:- it is the component which is to be rendered.

1. In router  we create an array of object with the function name "createBrowserRouter" and pass two things in the objects
-----> path:- it is the path of the component which is to be rendered.
-----> element:- it is the component which is to be rendered.

For example:-

const router = createBrowserRouter([
    {
      path: "/",
      element:  
      <>Element you want to render</>,
    },
    {
      path: "/about",
      element: 
      <>
      <About/>
      </>,
    }
  ])

3. Using RouterProvider we can use it where we want to call it

For example:-
<RouterProvider router={router}> ----> This command line is use to call the declared function
</RouterProvider>

4. change all anchor tag to Link tag after 
     import {Link} from 'react-router-dom'

-------> anchor tag will relaod the website upon clicking

5. Note that change the href to "to" for Link tag that is being used, upon rendering it will work link an anchor tag
   but this time it will not reload and be able to switch between pages without reloading.
