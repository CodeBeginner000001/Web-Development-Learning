Redirects and rewrites
--> You can configure redirect and rewrite rules for your Netlify site in two ways:

-> Save a plain text file called _redirects without a file extension to the publish directory of your site. 
   You can find _redirects file syntax details below.
-> Add one or more redirects tables to your Netlify configuration file. This method allows for more structured 
   configuration and additional capabilities,as described in the Netlify configuration file syntax section below.

   Syntax for the _redirects file
-> In a _redirects file, each redirect rule must be listed on a separate line, with the original path followed 
   by the new path or URL. Any line beginning with # will be ignored as a comment. Paths are case-sensitive 
   and special characters in paths must be url-encoded.

Here is an example:
# Redirects from what the browser requests to what we serve
/home                /
/blog/my-post.php    /blog/my-post
/news                /blog
/cuties              https://www.petsofnetlify.com
/authors/c%C3%A9line /authors/about-c%C3%A9line
You can customize and alter the redirect behavior by adding options to the end of each line such as HTTP status code, 
country conditions, or language conditions.
