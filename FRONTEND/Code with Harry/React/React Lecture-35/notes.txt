What is Infinite Scroll? 
Infinite Scroll is a technique used to load content continuously as the user scrolls 
down the page, eliminating the need for pagination.

How does it work in the code? In the code, Infinite Scroll is implemented using the 
react-infinite-scroll-component library. The InfiniteScroll component is used to wrap 
the content that needs to be loaded infinitely.

Key props:

-> dataLength: The length of the data that has been loaded so far.
-> next: A function that is called when the user reaches the end of the loaded data. 
         This function is responsible for loading more data.
-> hasMore: A boolean that indicates whether there is more data to be loaded.
-> loader: A component that is displayed while more data is being loaded.

How it's used in the code:

-> The InfiniteScroll component is used to wrap the div container that holds the news items.
-> The dataLength prop is set to the length of the articles array, which holds the loaded news items.
-> The next prop is set to the fetchMoreData function, which is responsible for loading more news items 
   when the user reaches the end of the loaded data.
-> The hasMore prop is set to a boolean that checks whether the length of the articles array is less than the total number of results.
-> The loader prop is set to a Spinner component, which is displayed while more data is being loaded.

How the fetchMoreData function works:

-> The fetchMoreData function is called when the user reaches the end of the loaded data.
-> It increments the page state by 1 and fetches more data from the API using the fetch function.
-> The fetched data is then concatenated with the existing articles array and the totalResult state is updated.
-> The setState method is used to update the state with the new data.

Benefits of Infinite Scroll:

-> Provides a better user experience by eliminating the need for pagination.
-> Allows users to scroll through a large amount of data without having to click on multiple pages.
-> Can improve page loading times by loading data only when it's needed.
