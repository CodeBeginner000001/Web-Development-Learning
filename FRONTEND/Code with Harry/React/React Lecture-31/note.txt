Question. -> Difference between createBrowserRouter and BrowserRouter and there use in the code ?

Answer. -> The BrowserRouter and createBrowserRouter are both used for client-side routing in React applications, 
           but they serve different purposes.

-> BrowserRouter is a component that establishes the context for routing within your application. 
   It listens to changes in the browser's URL and ensures that the correct React components are rendered 
   based on the current URL. It creates a dedicated context where route-related information is stored, 
   making it accessible to other components, such as Route and Link.

-> On the other hand, createBrowserRouter is a function that creates a router instance. It is used to create 
   a router that can be used to manage client-side routing in your application.

Here's an example of how to use BrowserRouter:
For example:-

import React from "react";
import { BrowserRouter as Router,Routes,Route } from "react-router-dom";

const App = () => {
  return 
  <Router>
   <Routes>
    <Route path="/" element={<Home />} />
    {/* your app components */}
   </Routes>
</Router>;
};

---> In this example, the entire application is wrapped with the BrowserRouter component, enabling client-side 
     routing for all child components within the router.

Here's an example of how to use createBrowserRouter:
As for createBrowserRouter, it is typically used to create a custom router instance, which can be used to manage 
routing in your application. Here's an example:
For example:-

import { createBrowserRouter , RouterProvider} from "react-router-dom";

const router = createBrowserRouter([
  {
    path: "/",
    element: <Home />,
  },
  {
    path: "/about",
    element: <About />,
  },
]);

const App = () => {
  return <RouterProvider router={router}>{/* your app components */}</RouterProvider>;
};

---> In this example, createBrowserRouter is used to create a custom router instance, which is then passed 
     to the RouterProvider component to manage routing in the application.

In summary, BrowserRouter is a component that establishes the context for routing, while createBrowserRouter 
is a function that creates a custom router instance. Both are used for client-side routing in React applications, 
but they serve different purposes.
