why my api key is undefined even if .env file is in the root


The issue is likely due to the fact that you're trying to access the REACT_NEWS_APP_API environment variable in your App.js file, but it's not being loaded correctly.

Here are a few things to check:

Make sure your .env file is in the root of your project: The .env file should be in the same directory as your package.json file.
Check the naming convention: Environment variables in a .env file should be in uppercase, so try renaming REACT_NEWS_APP_API to REACT_NEWS_APP_API_KEY (or something similar).
Restart your development server: After updating your .env file, restart your development server by running npm start or yarn start again.
Check if the variable is being loaded correctly: You can add a console.log statement in your App.js file to check if the environment variable is being loaded correctly:
javascript
Edit
Copy code
console.log(process.env.REACT_NEWS_APP_API_KEY);
If this logs undefined, then there's an issue with loading the environment variable.

Make sure you're using the correct syntax: In your .env file, the syntax should be:
Edit
Copy code
REACT_NEWS_APP_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
Note the syntax: VARIABLE_NAME=value.

If you've checked all of these and it's still not working, try creating a new .env file in the root of your project with a simple variable, like TEST_VAR=hello, and see if that gets loaded correctly. This will help you isolate the issue.
