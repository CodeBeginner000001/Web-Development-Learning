Note on React-Top-Loading-Bar

React-Top-Loading-Bar is a popular React library used to display a loading bar at the top of the page, 
indicating the progress of an operation. It's a simple and customizable way to provide feedback to 
users while data is being loaded or processed.

Example Syntax:
import LoadingBar from 'react-top-loading-bar';

class App extends React.Component {
  state = {
    progress: 0,
  };

  setProgress = (progress) => {
    this.setState({ progress });
  };

  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <LoadingBar
          color='#f11946'
          progress={this.state.progress}
          onLoaderFinished={() => this.setProgress(0)}
        />
        {/* Your app content here */}
      </div>
    );
  }
}

now you can pass this setProgress function and change the value to render it .

In this example:

We import the LoadingBar component from react-top-loading-bar.
We define a state progress to track the loading progress.
We create a setProgress function to update the progress state.
We render the LoadingBar component, passing the color, progress, and onLoaderFinished props.
-> color specifies the color of the loading bar.
-> progress sets the current progress of the loading bar (between 0 and 100).
-> onLoaderFinished is a callback function that will be called when the loading bar finishes (i.e., when progress reaches 100).
   By using React-Top-Loading-Bar, you can easily add a loading indicator to your React application, providing a better user experience during data loading or processing.
